					<h2>The Game</h2>
					<p class="indented">
						The classic sliding tile puzzle is a game composed of a grid of squares, each being a portion of an image. There is one portion missing, however, and the player has to
						slide tiles into the empty space to move them. The game is won when the player has put each section of the image back into its original spot. This is a simple game that
						has had numerous analog variants, and can use virtually any image to create the puzzle. As long as the pieces are rectangular, which all digital images are, a puzzle can be
						made by subdividing it and randomizing the pieces. The player of this version can provide a link to an image online (or potentially upload their own) and the page will divide
						it into a grid and randomize the sections, at which point the player will begin putting them back into place.

					<h2>Gameplay</h2>
					<h3>Mechanics</h3>
					<p>The player links to an image and moves the tiles around the board. Once the tiles are returned to the correct positions, the game is won.</p>
					<h3>Controls</h3>
					<p>Can be played by clicking/touching the tiles of the puzzle or via the arrow keys. The clicked tile will move to the empty space if it is adjacent to it. The arrow keys will
					move tiles around the empty space into that space (ex. right arrow will bring the tile to the left rightward to fill the empty spot).</p>
					<h3>Learning</h3>
					<p>The player learns by playing. The tiles are highly visual and draw the user to them via borders and animations. Once the user clicks, the tiles move. Hovering over a tile will
					show an overlay of the direction it will move (if it can move).</p>
