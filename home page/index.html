						<p>
						I grew up far away from the city. I wasn't just in a small town, I was <i>outside</i> of a small town. This was the sort of place where the most advanced tech was probably some sort 
						of corn harvester. With my school's limited computer classes, it's sort of a mystery as to why I'm here at RIT for a computer-related major. All I can say is, it's nice to finally be 
						somewhere where people know what a VM is and why recursion needs an exit condition... It was pretty lonely back home when my only relatable friend was an old laptop that could barely 
						play <i>Minecraft</i>.
